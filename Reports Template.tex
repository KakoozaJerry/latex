\section*{Abstract}


To obtain inherent laws from vast amounts of pharmaceutical sales data and to provide valuable information to pharmacy managers, this work validates different methods and approaches to perform a sales forecast. Part of the data is used to train a neural network algorithm, with backpropagation for some methods, step by step, where shallow nets face selected scenarios, with different space-time data considerations. 

\indent In each method, by using a sum of square differences, and a peak search procedure, a reasonable quality in the obtained abstract representations is pursued. First, an auto-encoder is trained to develop in its hidden layer neural data abstractions about a random-moving window. Thereafter by using the abstraction of the net plus recently captured information, a second shallow net is trained to produce its own one-day ahead estimates, using new timing and data procedures. After training, the whole stacked system’s performance is compared with the naive forecast scenario’s mean square error and if it's a better value, the method is used to produce stable daily forecasting for assorted products and periods. The system has been tested in real-time with real data.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
One of the responsibilities of pharmacies in  Uganda is to have a minimum stock of medicines.This ensures patients can have it when prescribed.

In addition, pharmacies need to get a good forecast of the medication needs due to the short term validity of many medicines and the need to control stock levels.This avoids excessive costs and loss of customers due to stock outages.\\

A good sales forecast is usually associated with striking a balance between stock costs and adequate satisfaction of customer demand.People act on the basis of forecasting models whether they are on paper or in their heads. You are better off quantifying these estimations so you can discuss them rationally as opposed to making them based on intuition.\\

To specific case of pharmacies in Uganda, the problem is of particular importance due to the short cycle life of many products and the importance of quality which is in turn strongly linked to public health.

Before digital technology dominated the world, the forecasting process was done manually by experienced individuals in the domain. This intuition required a lot of experience and was prone to error. Such a multifaceted problem started to realize the need for automating the pharmacy sales forecasting process. Research has been carried out with statistical, machine learning, deep learning and ensemble techniques to achieve more accurate sales forecasts. \cite{Perera2019}\\

During our research study of Soteria Pharmacy procurement process with an interview of Ms.Brenda the incharge of this, we realised she uses personal judgement of current stock levels athand and the rate at which people come in to ask for a ceratin drug then determine how much more stock should be purchased.Given her difficulties in accurately predicting the future sales,this report explores the product sales forecast at the indiviual level of this Pharmacy.I made a forecast for 5 sold drugs.The forecast was based on analysis of  historical data for a period of 24 months and future results analyses of 50 days determined.ARIMA and LSTM methods were used in the sales forecast of which the best model was recommended including a conclusive way of improving our results.
\section{Aims and Objectives}

The main aim of the research project was to precisely predict sales of drugs and medical supplies.

The specific objectives  were:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]

\item To collect datasets of previous sales and purchases from Soteria Pharmacy.

\item To train and validate datasets with ARIMA and LSTM models.

\item To optimize the best model algorithm for accurate performance.

\end{itemize}













\section{Contributions of the Project}

The following major contributions have been accomplished during the course of this research:

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt]

\item Performed a data cleaning task, analysis and training with the various Machine learning models and came up with a graphical output.

\item Developed a robust neural network model that could accurately predict future sales for a period of 50 days using a 2 year period worth of sales and purchases information.

\item Proposed a multivariate input approach with other characteristics such as precipitational weather information and promotional sales.

\end{enumerate}
